CNN tutorial
============

This is a tutorial on Convolutional Neural Networks. Its purpose 
is purely educational.  

- **CNNvsLNN**: This notebook explains the basic differences between fully 
connected layers and convolutional layers and their applications to images.  
- **About_filters_TensorFlow**: Train a network of fully connected layers and a network of 
convolutional layers on the same dataset and check the differences. Finally check the filters and 
feature maps on a VGG16 network pre-trained on ImageNet.  
- **About_filters_PyTorch**: Same as above except in PyTorch.  
- **Annex**: Explains the maths behind the forward and backward propagation of the layers.
